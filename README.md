# tic-tac-toe

Vanilla stack.

ATM desktop only.

May revisit to add AI.

First project using factory functions and modules, with attempts with structuring code inside objects.

Don't really like how code is structured, as it was the very first attempt at it, it's a little messy and could use some renaming/transferring between objects.  Will consider fixing that once I possibly get broader perspective on how to make it the optimal way.
